README:

The directory contains two compressed directories, 

1. EASY.zip
2. NUMERICAL_EXPERIMENTS.zip

The first one, obtained after unzipping EASY.zip, contains two subdirectories

CUB: it contains the files for numerical cubature over spherical polygons, as well as its demo "demo_cub_sphpgon";

HYP: it contains the files for classical hyperinterpolation over spherical polygons, as well as its demo "demo_cub_sphpgon";

The second one, obtained after unzipping NUMERICAL_EXPERIMENTS.zip, contains three subdirectories:

CUB01: by its codes, we perform all the cubature experiments of the paper (use demo_driver);

HYP01, HYP02: by its codes, we perform all the hyperinterpolation experiments of the paper (use demo_experiment_01, demo_experiment_02).
